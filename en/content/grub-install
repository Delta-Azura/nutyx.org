 <h1>Setting up GRUB</h1>
  <p>
   If you haven't installed GRUB yet (by mistake or on purpose), it's not too late. As you will see, it's very simple to install GRUB separately.
  <h2>To be able to install GRUB</h2>
   <p>
    It is not necessary to have NuTyX installed; you can install GRUB to any other distribution.
   <p>
     Restart the PC and boot the ISO

   <p>
     Once you arrive at the Main menu, choose "Boot Configure the boot of the PC (optional)" like this:

   <p>
     It's now time to ...
  <h2>Select the partition</h2>
   <p>
    We choose the partition where the GRUB application will be installed.
    Please note that the destination partition does <i>not</i> have to be on the disk you booted from.
    A menu appears giving you the chance to choose another disk.

  <h2>Grub is installed</h2>
   <p>
    It's now time to edit the <span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>grub.cfg</strong></span> file.

    Be aware of the syntax for addressing disks and partitions. It's a bit special.

   <p>
    With grub 2.00, the first hard drive is called <b>0</b> and the first partition is <b>1</b>. This means that the following example:
   <pre class="output">set root=(hd0,5)</pre>
   <p>
    defines the fifth partition on the first hard drive.
   <p>
    In the following example, we can see 2 entries: one of them is for NuTyX.
    The first entry will start the NuTyX distribution located on the <b>/dev/sda2</b> partition.
    The second entry will start Windows 10 located on <b>/dev/sda3</b>
   <pre class="output"># Begin grub.cfg
# By default boot the first menu entry.
set default 0
# Allow 5 seconds before booting the default.
set timeout 5<br />set color_highlight=blue/white
set color_normal=cyan/black<br />set gfxpayload=1024x768x16
menuentry "NuTyX  xfs on /dev/sda2" {
 set root=(hd0,2)
 linux /boot/kernel root=/dev/sda2 ro quiet
# initrd /boot/initrd
}
menuentry "Windows 10" {
 set root=(hd0,3)
 chainloader (hd0,3)+1
}
</pre>

 <h1>Setting up GRUB</h1>
  <p>
   If you haven't installed GRUB yet (by mistake or on purpose), it's not too late. As you will see, it's very simple to install GRUB separately.
  <h2>Important</h2>
  <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />
   It is strongly recommended not to use native grub commands.
   The grub.cfg file will be overwritten and will contain unnecessary information
   or even incompatible with NuTyX.
   Moreover, the menu structure will be lost.
  </div>
  <h2>To be able to install GRUB</h2>
   <p>
    It is not necessary to have NuTyX installed; you can install GRUB to any other distribution.
   <p>
     Restart the PC and boot the ISO

   <p>
     Once you arrive at the Main menu, choose "Boot Configure the boot of the PC (optional)" like this:

   <p>
     It's now time to ...
  <h2>Select the partition</h2>
   <p>
    Choose the partition where the GRUB application will be installed.
    Please note that the destination partition does <i>not</i> have to be on the disk you booted from.
    A menu appears giving you the chance to choose another disk.

  <h2>Grub is installed</h2>
   <p>
    It's now time to edit the <span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>grub.cfg</strong></span> file.

   <div class="important"><img src="../graphics/caution.gif" alt="caution" />
    Be aware of the syntax for addressing disks and partitions. It's a bit special.

   <p>
    With grub 2.00, the first hard drive is called <b>0</b> and the first partition is <b>1</b>. This means that the following example:
   <pre class="output">set root=(hd0,5)</pre>
   <p>
    defines the fifth partition on the first hard drive.
   <p>
    In the following example, we can see 4 entries: three of them are for NuTyX.
    The first entry will start the NuTyX distribution located on the <b>/dev/sda2</b> partition.
   <p>
    The second entry will start the NuTyX distribution located on the <b>/dev/sda2</b> partition with runyx as init system.
   <p>
    The third entry will start the NuTyX distribution located on the <b>/dev/sda2</b> partition with systemd as init system.
   <p>
    The last entry will start Windows 10 located on <b>/dev/sda3</b>

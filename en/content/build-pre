   <h1>Preparation of the construction</h1>
    <h2>If you are on NuTyX</h2>
     <p>
      Make sure the tools are installed:
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>get cards.devel git</kbd></pre>
    <h2>If you are not on NuTyX</h2>
      <p>
       You need to download the NuTyX installation script <b>install-nutyx</b>.
      <p>
       To make this topic transparent for all readers (NuTyX or not NuTyX user), you will need to put the script in a standard directory.
       You can delete it at the end of the creation.
      <p>
       Switch to root mode:
      <pre class="command_user"><kbd>su -</kbd></pre>
      <pre class="command"><kbd>wget http://www.nutyx.org/install-nutyx{,.md5sum}
md5sum -c install-nutyx.md5sum</kbd></pre>
      <pre class="output">install-nutyx: OK</pre>
      <pre class="command"><kbd>chmod -v 755 install-nutyx</kbd></pre>
      <pre class="output">mode of 'install-nutyx' changed from 0644 (rw-r--r--) to 0755 (rwxr-xr-x)</pre>
      <pre class="command"><kbd>mv -v install-nutyx /usr/bin/install-nutyx</kbd></pre>
      <pre class="output">'install-nutyx' -> '/usr/bin/install-nutyx'</pre>
      <p>
       Make sure you have the <b>bstar</b> command installed on your distribution.
      <p>
       You need to use the BASH interpreter.
      <p>

    <h2>If you have already done this process</h2>
     <p>
      It's necessary to remove the user (and its group it belongs to) and the home directory of the user lfs.
     <p>
      So if you need to do it, remove all existing stuff:
    <pre class="command"><kbd>userdel lfs
rm -r /home/lfs</kbd></pre>
     <p>
      If you didn't change the default value of the LFS variable, you should also remove the future NuTyX folder:
    <pre class="command"><kbd>rm -r /mnt/lfs</kbd></pre>
    <p>
     Normally, by removing the user, the group is removed as well.
     If you are not sure give it a try, it will not hurt.
    <pre class="command"><kbd>groupdel lfs</kbd></pre>
   <h2>Partition preparation</h2>
    <p>
     To be able to start the first pass without major trouble, let's see what has to be done.
     It's quite straightforward.
    <p>
     Normally if we build a linux distribution, it's necessary to plan a partition where to put its construction.
     It's actually not a necessity, as it's possible to build the distribution in a folder and then make a backup on a USB key or directly use the command rsync to transfer it to the destination disk or partition.
    <p>
     So if you decide to use a dedicated partition,
     it's time to format it in the file system of your choice and then you mount it on the folder defined by the LFS variable.
    <p>
     In all the articles we will used the same folder, so let's define the LFS variable:
    <pre class="command"><kbd>export LFS=/mnt/lfs</kbd></pre>
    Once your partition is formatted, it's time to create the folder and mount your partition on it.
    In my example, I have chosen the second partition of the first disk, you should adjust those settings to your choice.
    <pre class="command"><kbd>mkdir -pv $LFS
mount /dev/sda2 $LFS</kbd></pre>
    <p>
     Remember to always mount this partition prior to starting the pass 1 or 2.
     Once the partition is mounted, we can start the first pass.

<h1>Building an initrd</h1>
 <h2>What's an initrd ?</h2>
   If we stick to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk">Wikipedia</a>, in computing (specifically as regards Linux computing),
   initrd (initial ramdisk) is a scheme for loading a temporary root file system into memory,
   which may be used as part of the Linux startup process.
  <p>
   initrd and initramfs refer to two different methods of achieving this.
   Both are commonly used to make preparations before the real root file system can be mounted.
 <h2>What would you need an initrd for ?</h2>
  The first file your computer is loading is the kernel which is responsible of almost everything regarding hardware.
  The kernel is his name means, the core of the system. Unfortunatly, it can not guess things alone.
  You might use a RAID, LVM, NFS systems or an enencrypted partition. 
  For all thoses raisons, and perhaps more other, you need an initrd image to complete that task.
 <h2>How does it work on NuTyX</h2>
  An initrd have an naming schema that follows the name and the version of the kernel that is associate with.
  For example, if you are running on the latest kernel version as today.
  The name of the kernel is: <b><i>kernel-5.8.14-mainline</i></b> .
  If we look in the folder where all the kernels reside, we find indeed a kernel with such a name and linked file to it:
  <pre class="command_user"><kbd>ls -al /boot/kernel*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   22  7 oct 16:00 /boot/kernel -> kernel-5.8.14-mainline
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9.7M  7 oct 15:09 /boot/kernel-5.8.14-mainline
</kbd></pre>
  The link file is created during the post-installation of the kernel package by the package manager <a href="dictionary#ID000">cards</a>.
  If they would be an initrd with it's link,
  <p>
   In this example, the name of the initrd file would be: <b><i>initrd-5.8.14-mainline</i></b>
   And as the kernel-5.8.14-mainline file, a link file named initrd would be associate.
 <h2>Build an initrd</h2>
  If you decide to use an initrd image at boot time, you need to build the initrd yourself ONES.
  To build this file, the only restriction is that you have the root credencies rights.
  Either you use sudo command either <a href="faq#8">you activate the root account</a> and switch to root:
  <p>
   To know which kernel you are running on, use this command:
   <pre class="command_user"><kbd>uname -r</kbd></pre>
   <pre class="output">4.9.238-NuTyX-49</pre>
   I'm running on the kernel 4.9 LTS version and going to build an initrd for it.
   The command <i>mkinitramfs</i> needs one argument which is exactly the result of the <i>uname -r</i> above.
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo mkinitramfs 4.9.238-NuTyX-49</kbd></pre>
    <pre class="output">[sudo] Mot de passe de thierry : 
Creating ... 
done.</pre>
  <p>
   If we look in the folder where all the kernels reside, we find indeed a new file named: initrd-4.9.238-NuTyX-49
   <pre class="command_user"><kbd>l /boot -tr </kbd></pre>
   <pre class="output">.....
...
..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  80M 10 oct 19:47 initrd-4.9.238-NuTyX-49
drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4.0K 10 oct 19:47 .</pre>
  <p>
   As mentionned earlier, we also need to buildup a link <b><u>with the right name</u></b> so that <a href="dictionary#ID000">cards</a> can do the upgrade process of this initrd.
   As a convention, the name of the link is ALWAYS made of <i>init</i> and last part of the initrd filename separated by a dash, in our example:
   <p>
    <b>initrd-49</b>
   <p> We can now make the link with following command:
   <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo ln -svf initrd-4.9.238-NuTyX-49 /boot/initrd-49</kbd></pre>
   <pre class="output">[sudo] Mot de passe de thierry : 
'/boot/initrd-49' -> 'initrd-4.9.238-NuTyX-49'</pre>
   <p>
    That's it, we are done and ready to check if the upgrade process works.
   
 <h2>Check the upgrade process</h2>
  <p>Checking the upgrade consist just of reinstalling the <i>kernel-49</i> package:
   <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards install kernel-49</kbd></pre>
   <pre class="output">[sudo] Mot de passe de thierry :
  kernel-49 4.9.238-1   62.70 MB (111.97 MB/s) 100 % - 0 s

  <p>
   We can see by the result above that an new initrd have been created.
   Still with following command, everything should be clear:
   <pre class="command_user"><kbd>l /boot -tr </kbd></pre>
   <pre class="output">.....
...
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   23 10 oct 20:13 kernel-49 -> kernel-4.9.238-NuTyX-49
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   23 10 oct 20:13 initrd-49 -> initrd-4.9.238-NuTyX-49
drwxr-xr-x 35 root root 4.0K 10 oct 20:13 ..
drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4.0K 10 oct 20:13 .</pre>   
 <h2>Adjusting your GRUB</h2>
 Adjusting the grub is explain <a href="nutyx-man#10">here</a>.
 Only adjust the name of initrd with your.
 <p>
  Good luck !!!

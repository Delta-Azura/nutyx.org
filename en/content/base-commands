  <h1>The base commands...</h1>
   <h2>Give it a try</h2>
    <p>
     To take full advantage of your newly installed NuTyX, here are the ESSENTIAL commmands that you will have to use every day.
     This article explains some essential commands that are specific to NuTyX. We strongly recommend that you learn them.
    <p>
    NuTyX does not (yet) have a graphical interface tool for administrative purposes.
    You will need to use the terminal as your normal interface.
    If you are not yet used to it, that's not a big deal; we will explain the commands you need to type.
    <p>
     Since NuTyX is a Linux operating system, it's important to respect the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity">case</a> when entering commands.
     ALL the characters in a command are in <b>lowercase</b>.
    <p>
     Let's start by opening a terminal. Ready? OK, let's go <img src="../graphics/smiley-cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool" />
    <p>
     In some cases, a command consists of a single word without any options or arguments, but most commands have many options.
     We suggest that you to use the commands --help option to get an idea of what other options are available.
     Here, we will only check the most common ones:
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>commandname help</kbd></pre> or
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>commandname --help</kbd></pre> or
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>commandname -h</kbd></pre>
    <p>
     the <i>help</i> makes it possible to print out all the available options. <i>--help</i> or <i>-h</i> are alternative options for printing out the help text for a command.
   <h2>Check if there are any updates available</h2>
    <p>
     The command <b>cards sync</b> will check the latest status of the available updates for your system.
    <p>
     The command <b>cards diff</b> will show a list of outdated packages.
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards sync
sudo cards diff</kbd></pre>
     <pre class="output">synchronizing /var/lib/pkg/saravane/desktop from http://..<br />/var/lib/pkg/saravane/desktop//MD5SUM<br />..
Difference between installed packages and the depot of binaries:
Package                      Installed                   Available in the depot of binaries
gcc                          4.9.1                       4.9.2
glibc                        2.20                        2.21</pre>
   <h2>Updating a package</h2>
    <p>
     To update a package, the command <b>cards install -u</b> followed by the package will be used. Of course it is necessary that an update is available:
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards install -u gcc</kbd></pre>
   <h2>Search a package</h2>
    <p>
     To search for a package, the command:
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>cards search <b>search_string</b></kbd></pre>
    <p>
     will return all the packages which have the <b>search_string</b> in the name or in the description. For example, if you want to know what browsers are available:
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>cards search browser</kbd></pre>
    <p>
     should return something like:
    <pre class="output">(gui-extra) chromium 53.0.2785.116 The open-source project behind Google Chrome,
an attempt at creating a safer, faster, and more stable browser
(gui-extra) conkeror git A highly programmable web browser based on Mozilla XULRunner
(gui-extra) dillo 3.0.5 A small, fast graphical web browser built on FLTK
(gui-extra) firefox 48.0.2 Standalone web browser from mozilla.org
(gui-extra) midori 0.5.11 Midori is a lightweight web browser that uses WebKitGTK+.
(gui-extra) xombrero 1.6.4 Simple browser based on gtk and using the webkit engine
...</pre>
   <h2>Add a package</h2>
     <p>
      To add a package, the command <b>cards install</b> is used followed by the name of the software package to install:
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards install xfce4</kbd></pre>
     <p>
      The download of the application <b>xfce4</b> starts immediately.
      Once the package is downloaded, its dependencies will be downloaded as well.
      When the download is finished, all these packages will be installed in the right order.
      In this example, when the command is complete, you will have a working <a href="http://www.xfce.org">xfce4</a> desktop installed on your NuTyX.
   <h2>Add a user</h2>
    <p>
     Adding a user under NuTyX is very simple. The command:
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo nu</kbd></pre>
    <p>
     will add a new user, you will be asked two questions:
    <pre class="output">Name of the user: james
Name or Description of the user: James Bond 007</pre>
    <p>
     You should ensure that the user name does not contain any special characters, spaces or capital letters.
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>
     As you can see the only two commands you really need to know are:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>nu
cards</kbd></pre>
     <p>
      This last command has a more detailed explanation <i>via</i> in its help option
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>cards help</kbd></pre>
     <p>
      I wish you a lot of fun with you newly installed NuTyX.
     <p>

 <h2>Create a bootable USB key</h2>
  <p>
   If you are currently running GNU/linux on your machine:
   <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />As root </div>
  <p>
   With the help of fdisk, find out where your USB key is located:
   <pre class="command"><kbd>fdisk -l</kbd></pre>
  <p>
   Then by using the command <b>dd</b>, create a bootable key:
   <pre class="command"><kbd>dd if=NuTyX_x86_64-BASE-21.07.3.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress</kbd></pre>
  <p>
   The <b>sdX</b> value is the one that you have previously found using fdisk.
  <p>
   If you are using Windows, it is easier to burn the ISO image onto a CD.

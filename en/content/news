 4 news ISOs are available.
 <ul>
  <li>
  <b><i>in 64 bits:</i></b>
   <p>
    The first ISO is a base NuTyX "rolling" version with a size of 384 Mbytes.
   <p>
    A 4.5 GBytes ISO base NuTyX "fixed" version which contains a complete repository of the binaries for the NuTyX 11.2 release.
    You can install NuTyX 11.2 completely without having to use internet.
    To install packages from this ISO, once your base system is installed, configured and booting,
    it's just a question of mounting the media on the <b>/mnt</b> mounting point.
   <p>
    Suppose you media is found under <b>/dev/sdc1</b>, uses following command to mount it:
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt</kbd></pre>
    Adapt in consequence.
   <p>
    A 1.7 GByte MATE desktop in "rolling" version.
  <li>
  <b><i>in 32 bits:</i></b>
   <p>
    A 310 Mbytes ISO base NuTyX "rolling" version.

<h2>CARDS</h2>
<h3>The six official collections</h3>
 <p>
  The number of official collections is now 6:
<p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   base 
 <li>
   cli
 <li>
   cli-extra
 <li>
   gui
 <li>
   gui-extra
 <li>
   desktops
 </ul>
 <p>
  All the supported desktops graphical interface under NuTyX are in the <b><u><i>desktops</i></u></b> collection.
 <p>
  Collections <i>nos, lxde, mate, kde5, gnome et xfce4</i> will be removed from the mirrors servers.
 <div class="important">
  It is therefore important to update <b>manually</b> the configuration file <i>/etc/cards.conf</i> as explained below.
   A successful update can not be done without this manipulation.
 </div>
<h3>A set of packages</h3>

<p>
 The concept of "set of packages" is introduced.
 A package set is a set of packages that add important functionality such as a graphical desktop.
 Henceforth, the main desktops (kde5, xfce4, mate, etc..) are considered as sets of packages.
<p>
 To install a supported desktop under NuTyX, the command remains the same, for example for kde5 (Plasma5):
<pre class="command_user"><kbd>get kde5</kbd></pre>

<h3>New recipe syntax</h3>
<p>
 The syntax of a recept have been review.
 Following a very relevant bug return, I decided to stop keyword support via a comment in a package build recipe.
 The definition of a recipe is therefore only via variables and tables.
 Comments are now considered comments only.
 The large number of updates is largely the consequence of this new feature.
 <p>
  Recipe example using the new syntax:
  
<pre class="output">description="My first package with plenty of  dependancies"
url="http://www.my-first-package.org/"

packager="fpr <fpr@nutyx.org>"
contributors="Tnut"

# Compilation dependencies table
makedepends=(python gtk3 librsvg)

# Runtime dependencies table
run=(gtk-update-icon-cache)

# Set of packages table
set=(mate gnome)

name=mypackage
version=1.0.0
release=1
source=(${url}downloads/$name/$name-$version.tar.xz)
build() {
   cd $name-$version
   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make
   make DESTDIR=$PKG install
}</pre>

<h2>Upgrade process</h2>
<p>
 Since this is a minor release, an upgrade is possible.
<p>
 Please use following commands to proceed:
<p>
 We start by creating a new <i>/etc/cards.conf</i> file:
  <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo bash</kbd></pre>
  <pre class="command"><kbd>echo "url http://downloads.nutyx.org" > /etc/cards.conf
for i in desktops gui-extra gui cli-extra cli base
do
   echo "dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/$i" >> /etc/cards.conf
done
echo "base /var/lib/pkg/depot/base
group en
version rolling" >> /etc/cards.conf
exit</kbd></pre>
<p>
 If you don't know the shortcut of your language, rerun the command:
<pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo bash</kbd></pre>
<pre class="command"><kbd>setup-nutyx -cl
exit</kbd></pre> 
 <pre class="command_user"><kbd>check</kbd></pre>
 We can now start the upgrade process:
 <pre class="command_user"><kbd>check
sudo cards upgrade</kbd></pre>

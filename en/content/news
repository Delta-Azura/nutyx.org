    You can install NuTyX 11.3 completely without having to use the internet.
    To install packages from this ISO, once your base system is installed, configured and booting,
    it's just a question of mounting the media on the <b>/mnt</b> mounting point.
   <p>
    Suppose you media is found under <b>/dev/sdc1</b>, use the following command to mount it:
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt</kbd></pre>
    Change this command to reflect your system.

      When a package is not existing anymore, cards throws an error message instead of freezing.

    <p>
      The command <b>cards search</b> is looking in every posssible information, means seach can be done based on version, url and packager infos as well.

 <h2>What's up ?</h2>

  <h3>New LTS 5.15 kernel</h3>
   <p>
    A new LTS 5.15.x kernel is available.
    The package name is: <b>kernel-515</b>

  <h3>Semi-automatic and automatic mode of installations</h3>
   <p>
    Installation progress is now calculated accurately.
    The installer has been rewritten.

  <h3>Kernel installation</h3>
   <p>
     With the stabilization of the UEFI installation mode,
     the links used in the kernel package are deprecated.
     This drastic change may render your machine unusable
     if it was more than 6 months ago in uefi mode during experimental times.
   <p>
     After 15 years, I finally decided to get rid of these links
     which seriously disturb the grub-mkconfig tool (among others).

  <h3>Fully Custom Installation in Live Mode</h3>
   <p>
     A new command is available to enter an installed NuTyX.
     The <b>chroot-nutyx</b> command is now available.

  <h3>cards list --sets</h3>
   <p>
    The <b>cards list --sets</b> command displays the list of available packages sets.


  <h3>docker available</h3>
   <p>
    The ability to use docker was a recurring request under NuTyX.

  <h3>The mybld command</h3>
   <p>
    mybld is the central command for building packages under NuTyX.
     Many small bugs have been corrected, further simplified use and
     new features added. Read the manual :)

  <h3>NuTyX specific themes (still in progress)</h3>
   <p>
    The themes under the different desktops are more consistent.
     Thank you Hakerdefo for the valuable advice.

 <h2>Bug fixes</h2>
   <p>
    Following issues are now fixed:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Unable to install an ISO (KDE for example) on a machine with 1GB of RAM.
     <li>
      On some ISOs, the progress bar seems to freeze and block the installation.
      Nothing happens for several minutes.
     <li>
      Installing NuTyX in live mode failed.

 <h2>Known bugs  (in progress)</h2>
  <p>
   The problems below are still present:
    <ul>
     <li>
      If you are using GDM as session manager (default on gnome ISO),
      it is necessary to use the virtual keyboard,
      the configuration of this one remains in us keyboard.
    </ul>

 <h2>Deprecated features</h2>
  <p>
   The runyx init system will be removed in the future.
   It will always be available for launching an initrd
   via the 'busybox' package in which 'runit' is integrated.
  <p>
   The method of building packages via the 'ports' command will be deprecated.
   The mybld command becomes the central command for building packages.
  <p>
   The 'sources' group of packages will be removed see below: what's next

 <h2>Upgrade process</h2>
  <p>
   Even if NuTyX 22.02.4 is a minor release.
 </p><pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards upgrade</kbd></pre>

 <h2>What's next</h2>
  <p>
   There will be a new toolchain with glibc 2.35.
  <p>
    Paradigm of cards will be adjusted to the new "git world"
    as it is now the dominant source code repository method.
    A new approach for the source code of our packages will be developed.
  <p>
   The runyx init system will be abandoned.
   Maintaining 2 inits is already a lot of work.
   The selection of an init system will be done at installation time
   so that it won't be needed to change your grub anymore.
   Only 2 init systems will be offered.
   <ul>
    <li>
     systemv
    <li>
     systemd
   </ul>

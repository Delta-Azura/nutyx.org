 The base of NuTyX comes with the new kernel LTS 4.19.28 and the very new kernel 5.0.3.
<p>
 The toolchain is completely rebuild around glibc 2.29, gcc 8.3.0 and binutils 2.32.
<p>

<p>
 2 news BASE ISO are available.
<p>
 The first ISO is a base NuTyX "rolling" version with a size of 385 Mbytes and the second ISO is a base NuTyX "fixed" version which contains a completed binaries repository of the 11.0 NuTyX.
 It's size is 5.3 Gbytes.
<p>
 With this last ISO, you can install a complete NuTyX  11.0 without having to use internet.
<p>
 To install packages from this ISO, onces your base system is installed, configured and booting, it's just a question of mounting the media on the <b>/mnt</b> mounting point.
<p>
 Suppose you media is found under <b>/dev/sdc1</b>, uses following command to mount it:
  <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt</kbd></pre>
 Adapt in consequence.
<p>
 ISOs are available on <a href="downloads">the download page.</a>
<p>
 The installer has been spit in two installation modes: Simple and Advanced installation mode.
<p>
 Available graphical interfaces are:
 kde5, mate, xfce4, lxde, lxqt, gnome, flwm, jwm, ratpoison, blackbox, fluxbox, openbox, bspwm, icewm, twm, etc.
<h2>CARDS</h2>
 <p>
  CARDS is now able to track orphelin packages and take care of them... by removing them automaticaly :)
 <p>
  Locales are now beter treated, as they are automaticaly installed when they are available.
  For example if we install libreoffice, the correct locale will be installed automatically.
<h2>Upgrade process</h2>
<p>
 Since this is a major release, an update is not recommanded.
<p>
 The best way to test this new version it's by remove your existing one and install the new one, possible from this ISO. Your personnal data files won't be touched

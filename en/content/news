<h2>NuTyX 10.4 available with cards 2.4.81</h2>
<p>
 I'm very please to annonce the new NuTyX 10.4 release.
<p>
 NuTyX 10.4 comes with kernel lts 4.14.78 (4.9.114 in 32bits), glibc 2.28, gcc 8.2.0, binutils 2.30, python 3.7.0,
 xorg-server 1.20.1, qt 5.11.2, gtk 3.24.1, gimp 2.10.6,
 plasma 5.12.6 LTS (in 64bits) , kf5 5.50.0 (in 64bits), mate 1.20.1, xfce4 4.12.3, firefox 62.0.3, etc....
<p>
 A second kernel is proposed for people who want to use the very last version of the kernel 4.17.11
<p>
 NuTyX 10.3 user's are invited to upgrade.
<p>
 With the model release of NuTyX (fixed and rolling release, see below),
 five news ISOs are available in 64 bits and 32 bits.
 Sizes are from  296 MB up to 1.24G.
 They are available on the <a href="downloads">download page.</a>
<p>
 The 64 bits is available in "Fixed" and "Rolling" releases as a base and a MATE ISO.
<p>
 The 32 bits is now only available in "Rolling" release and as a base ISO.
 This version is EOL means only critical issues are applied.
<p>
 The EFI installation have been improved, but it's still experimental and limited.
<p>
 The installer has been spit in two installation modes: Simple and Advanced installation mode.
<p>
 Available graphical interfaces are:
 kde5, mate, xfce4, lxde, flwm, jwm, ratpoison, blackbox, fluxbox, openbox, bspwm, icewm, twm, etc.
<p>
  The GNOME GUI is no longer part of the graphical interfaces available under NuTyX.
  Systemd and the latest version of GNOME (3.30) are more than ever linked,
  it becomes almost impossible to propose a functional gnome graphical interface.
 <p>
  In the future, gnome applications (which do not depend on systemd) will be moved to the gui-extra collection.

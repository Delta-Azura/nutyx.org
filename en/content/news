 <h2>What's new ?</h2>
  <p>
   With the up and coming release of the new NuTyX version.
   There has been a major development in the init system.

  <h3> RuNyX, SysV or systemD as init system</h3>
   <p> 
    NuTyX now comes with 3 init systems rolled into 1.
    So what that means is, the user can choose which init they wish to use, SysV, SystemD, or RuNyX (runit fork).
   <p>
    This makes for a wider User choice.
    The main base init will always be SysV.
    This means that  RuNyX and SystemD packages can always be removed.
    This also means that the Sysinit package must remain install in all cases, as it is used by all 3 inits modes.
   <p>
    you have a choice at boot time on the conventional GRUB menu.
   <p>
    In the newest release, base NuTyX comes with the Long-Term Support (LTS) kernel 4.19.161 and the latest stable 5.9.12
    Changelogs for the kernels are available here:
   <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.19.161">kernel 4.19.161 changelog</a>
   <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.9.12">kernel 5.9.12 changelog</a>
   
  <h3>Software Core change</h3>
   <h4>RuNyX</h4>
    <p>
     NuTyX propose now it's own init system call RuNyX. 
     RuNyX is a fork of the <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">Gerrit Pape runit project</a>.
     We mainly added the missing components to make this init system working properly in all situations.
    <p> 
     We also decide to use our own directory schema to be more consistant with the other init system.
     You should consult the documentation for more info.
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards install runyx.man
man runit</kbd></pre>
   <h4>Busybox</h4>
    <p>
     Busybox is part of the core NuTyX system.
     This makes it possible to reduce the size of a basic NuTyX.
     The initrd is also considerably reduced.
   <h4>Elogind</h4>
    <p>
     At first we want to take profit of systemd init and use systemd for the logind daemon, this was not working.
     After several tests, we could successfully make elogind working and replace completly the obsolet consolekit2 package.
   <h4>Eudev</h4>
    <p>
     Eudev package is now the eudev part of systemd project.
     It's working on all 3 inits and on the ISOs without problems.
   <h4>Systemd</h4>
    <p>
     Systemd comes by default with many modules. 
     To make NuTyX still working and compatible as much as possible with todays rolling NuTyX version,
     some main modules have been disable:
     <ul>
      <li>
       timed (ntp)
      <li>
       networkd (dhcpcd, networkmanager)
      <li>
       resolve (dhcpcd, networkmanager)
      <li>
       SysV compat (sysVinit)
     </ul>
 <h2>Thanks</h2>
  <p>
   Thank you to all my team for the feedback from the tests carried out on this new version.
  <p>
   A special thank you to Spiky for his great patience and attention to detail.
 <h2>Manual update procedure process</h2>
  <p>
   <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />
    Since this is a major release, an upgrade is possible but need to be done manualy.
    At this stage of development, be aware that this manual manipulation might break your NuTyX installation.
    Do it at your own risk
   </div>
   <p>
    You are welcome on the new <a class="url" href="https://t.me/groupnutyx">Telegram channel</a> to ask for support on this procedure.
   <h3>Adjust the /etc/cards.conf</h3>
    <p>
     Add following line:
     <pre class="output">version testing</pre>
     in /etc/cards.conf file
   <h3>Upgrade your NuTyX</h3>
    <p>
     Start the upgrade process:
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards upgrade</kbd></pre>
   <h3>Remove dhcpcd if you are running networkmanager</h3>
    <p>
     To make systemd and runyx init system working properly, dhcpcd cannot be installed together with networkmanager.
     If your network is setup by networkmanager, do
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards remove -a dhcpcd</kbd></pre>
   <h3>Install systemd and runyx packages</h3>
    <p>
     Install the systemd and/or runyx packages depending what you like to test:
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards install systemd runyx</kbd></pre>
   <h3>Adjust your grub entries</h3>
    <p>
     To adjust a grub entries for example your 'NuTyX LTS Quiet' entry:
     Replace:
     <pre class="output">ro quiet verbose=no</pre>
     With:
      <pre class="output">init=/sbin/runit-init ro quiet verbose=no</pre>
     for RuNyX <b><u>OR</u></b>
      <pre class="output">init=/sbin/systemd-init ro quiet verbose=no</pre>
     for Systemd init.
    <h3>Reboot your computer</h3>
     <p>
      You can now reboot your machine.
      Good luck with your upgrade procedure.

 <h2>What's up ?</h2>
  <p>
   With the upcoming release of the new NuTyX version,
   there has been a major development in the init system.

  <h3>The installer keeps your personal data</h3>
   <p>
    Now if you want, you can install the latest NuTyX without having to wipe / format the destination partition.
    The system folders will simply be replaced and the personal folder (/ home) kept.

  <h3>Flatpak available</h3>
   <p>
    A great effort has been made to allow the proper integration of the universal flatpak packages.
    This new functionality therefore makes it possible to install many new packages.

  <h3>New Telegram group</h3>
   <p>
    You are welcome to the new <a class="url" href="https://t.me/groupnutyx">Telegram group</a> to discuss the project or ask us for help.

  <h3>New contributor</h3>
   <p>
    Schrodinger72 came to join the team to contribute on NuTyX.
    His IT experience is very useful.

  <h3>RuNyX, SysV or systemD as init system</h3>
   <p>
    NuTyX now comes with 3 initialization systems put together in 1.
    So what this means is that the user can choose which initialization they want to use,
    SysV, SystemD or RuNyX (fork of runit).
   <p>
    This allows a wider choice for the user.
    The main base init is SysV.
    This means that the RuNyX and SystemD packages can be dropped if you wish to use SySV only.
    The Sysinit package must remain installed in all cases.
    It is used by the 3 init modes.
   <p>
    You have a choice at boot time in the conventional GRUB menu.

  <h3>Changes in the heart of software.</h3>

   <h4>RuNyX</h4>
    <p>
     NuTyX now offers its own RuNyX initialization system.
     RuNyX is a fork of the <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">Gerrit Pape runit projet</a>.
     We mainly added the missing components to make this boot system
     work properly in all situations.
    <p> 
     We also decide to use our own directory scheme to be more consistent with the other init systems.
     See the documentation for more information.
     </p><pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards install runyx.man
man runit</kbd></pre>
     
   <h4>Busybox</h4>
    <p>
     Busybox is part of the core NuTyX system.
     This makes it possible to reduce the size of a basic NuTyX.
     The initrd is also considerably reduced.

   <h4>elogind</h4>
    <p>
     At first we wanted to take advantage of systemd and use systemd for the logind daemon, it didn't work.
     After several tests we were able to get elogind to work and
     completely replace the obsolete consolekit2 package.

   <h4>Eudev</h4>
    <p>
     The Eudev package is now the eudev part of the systemd project.
     It works on all 3 inits and on ISOs without problems.

   <h4>Systemd</h4>
    <p>
     Systemd ships with many modules by default.
     To keep NuTyX running and compatible as much as possible with the current version of NuTyX,
     some core modules have been disabled:
     </p><ul>
      <li>
       timed (ntp)
      </li><li>
       networkd (dhcpcd, networkmanager)
      </li><li>
       resolve (dhcpcd, networkmanager)
      </li><li>
       SysV compat (sysVinit)
     </li></ul>

 <h2>Upgrade process</h2>
  <p>
   Even if NuTyX 20.12.0 is a major release, an upgrade process is possible and as simple as:
 </p><pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards upgrade</kbd></pre>

 <h2>Thanks</h2>
  <p>
   Thank you to all my team for the feedback from the tests carried out on this new version.
  <p>
   A special thank you to Spiky for his great patience and attention to detail.
  <p>
   Thanks to Schrodinger72 for joining the team.

    You can install NuTyX 11.3 completely without having to use the internet.
    To install packages from this ISO, once your base system is installed, configured and booting,
    it's just a question of mounting the media on the <b>/mnt</b> mounting point.
   <p>
    Suppose you media is found under <b>/dev/sdc1</b>, use the following command to mount it:
    <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt</kbd></pre>
    Change this command to reflect your system.

<h2>What's new ?</h2>
 <h3>ISO</h3>
    <p>
      The installer sets the right keyboard in graphical mode for many countries.
    <p>
      The ISO is using the minimal in RAM when booting up.
      This speeds up the BOOT process.
      In case of, a new entry is added to give the possibility to load the ISO in RAM if necessary.
 <h3>CARDS</h3>
    <p>
      When a package is not existing anymore, cards throws an error message instead of freezing.
    <p>
      When a folder without Pkgfile file is tracked by cards, an error will be throw in the terminal when commands cards deptree cards depends or cards create are used.
    <p>
      The command <b>cards search</b> is looking in every posssible information, means seach can be done based on version, url and packager infos as well.
    <p>
      The command <b>cards upgrade</b> now takes care of synchronisation the meta datas, upgrading and cleaning the cache.
      It's no longer needed to make a <b><i>sudo cards sync</i></b> and a <b><i>sudo cards purge</i></b> if <b>cards upgrade</b> is used.

<h1>The five collections</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
   They are a lot of synonyms for defining a set of packages in the informatics jargon.
  <p>
   Under NuTyX, a set of packages is held in a collection.
  <p>
   They are 5 officials collections on NuTyX.
  <p>
   A collection includes 3 fundamental properties:
   <ul>
     <li>
      Independent
     <li>
      Hierarchy
     <li>
      Interdepencies between them
   </ul>
   Even if these properties could look contradictory, we will see in this tutorial why they are justified.
     
 <h2>Definition</h2>
   Under NuTyX, a collection is a set of recepts and binaries packages.
   This set provide certain functionalities.
   These functionalities are organised as follows:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Librairies and utilities for a base system
    <li>
     Librairies and utilities for a command line interface (cli)
    <li>
     Librairies and utilities for a graphical user interface (gui)
    <li>
     Extra librairies and utilities for a command line interface (cli-extra)
    <li>
     Extra librairies and utilities for a graphical user interface (gui-extra)
    <li>
     Graphicals interface
   </ul>
    At the moment, some  of the most common graphical interfaces are available:
    <ul>
     <li>
      GNOME
     <li>
      XFCE4
     <li>
      KDE5
     <li>
      MATE
     <li>
      LXDE
     <li>
       LXQT
     <li>
       ENLIGHTENMENT
    </ul>
  <h2>Collections management via cards</h2>
   Because of their concept, each collection contains it's own meta-data files.
   When adding / removing a package from a collection, only the meta-data files of this collection will need to be modified.
   This property offers maximum flexibility to the users and to the Package manager.
  <h2>Collections hierachy</h2>
   The hierachy of collections is an important concept. 
    <p>
    Here the symbol "->" should be interpreted as "depends on"
    <p>
     Here is the fundamental rule:
    <p>
     cli-extra -> cli -> base
    <p>
     gui-extra -> gui -> cli -> base
    <p>
     With this well established rule, the following concept is defined:
     <ul>
      <li>
       A package from the <i>base</i> collection can only use dependencies from the same <i><u>base</u></i> collection.
      <li>
       A package from the <i>cli</i> collection can only use dependencies from <i><u>base</u></i> or <i><u>cli</u></i> collections.
      <li>
       A package from the <i>cli-extra</i> collection can only use dependencies from <i><u>base</u></i> or <i><u>cli</u></i> collections.
      <li>
       A package from the <i>gui</i> collection can only use dependencies from <i><u>base</u></i>, <i><u>cli</u></i> or <i><u>gui</u></i> collections.
      <li>
       A package from the <i>gui-extra</i> collection, including all available graphical interfaces on NuTyX,  can only use dependencies from <i><u>base</u></i>, <i><u>cli</u></i> or <i><u>gui</u></i> collections.
     </ul>

  <h2>Interdependencies</h2>
    The NuTyX collections are interdependent in the following ways: 
    <ul>
     <li>
      <b>base</b>:
       The <i>base</i> collection is the set of a minimum base system, it will always be needed.
       All the others collections depend on the <i>base</i> collection.
    <li>
     <b>cli</b>:
       The <i>cli</i> collection contains all the libraries and applications used by a command line interface.
     <p>
      Only the <i>base</i> collection is a dependencie of the <i>cli</i> collection.
    <li>
     <b>gui</b>:
      The <i>gui</i> collection contains all the libraries and applications used by a graphical interface.
      The <i>base</i> and <i>cli</i> collections are dependencies of the <i>gui</i> collection.
    <li>
     <b>cli-extra</b>:
      The <i>cli-extra</i> collection contains applications used by a command line interface.
    <p>
      The <i>base</i> and <i>cli</i> collections are the dependencies of the <i>gui</i> collection.

    <li>
     <b>gui-extra</b>:
     The <i>gui-extra</i> collection contains apllications used by a graphical interface.
    <p>
     The <i>base</i>, <i>cli</i> and <i>gui</i> are the dependencies of the <i>gui-extra</i> collection.
   </ul>
 <h2>The groups of collection</h2>
  <h3>A. The base system collection</h3>
   <p>
    The collection consisting of the base system is:
   <ul>
    <li>
      base
   </ul>
  <h3>B. The core system collections</h3>
   <p>
    The collections consisting of the core system are:
 <ul>
   <li>
    cli
   <li>
    gui
 </ul>
  <h3>C. The Extra collections</h3>
   <p>
    The 'extra' collections are:
 <ul>
   <li>
    cli-extra
   <li>
    gui-extra
 </ul>
   
  <h2>And now ?</h2>
   Collections have no more secrets for you. Now is the time to try to <a href="mybld">compile in an isolated chroot</a>.

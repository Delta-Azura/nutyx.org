    <p>
     It's done in a few steps:
     <ul>
      <li>
        send an email to one of &lt;mailing_list_name&gt;-request@nutyx.org (<i>nutyx-support-request@nutyx.org</i> for example) by specifying:
       <b><i>subscribe</i></b> as the subject.
      <li>
       You will receive a confirmation mail. Check your spam mail.
      <li>
       Simply answer this last email by choosing "Reply" on your favorite email software.
      <li>
       After a few minutes you will receive an  email that confirms you are registered on the mailing-list
      </ul>

   <h2>NuTyX is not a multi-lib</h2>
    <p>
     It takes much more time to build up a multilib distribution.
     Normally all the libraries need to be compiled in 64 and 32 bits.
    <p>
     Today, it's not possible to produce a multilib because there are links created at construction / installation of NuTyX (lib64->lib) under /lib and /usr.

   <h2>The installer doesn't allow me to specify a separate /home partition</h2>
    <p>
     This question has been asked many times.
     I will try to answer it as clearly  as possible.
    <p>
     Modern users often have a lot of data on their computers.
     The size of the home folder can quickly become very large.
     MP3 files, photos and videos are big files.
    <p>
     Imagine that you have a 250 GB hard disk.
     You say &quot;OK, I'll take 100 GB for the system and 150 GB for my personal data.&quot;
     Great! You just cut your disk into two pieces, and the home partition will fill up more quickly in proportion to its size than if you had retained a single partition.
     It would be nice if we could reinstall NuTyX when we wanted without having to cut the hard disk into separate partitions to preserve personal data.
     <u>That's exactly how the NuTyX installer works</u>.
    <ul>
     <li>
      The installer will never format a partition that is already formated, without manual intervention.
    <li>
      If you have a distribution (NuTyX or any other) with personal data and the system on the same partition,
      the installer will tell you during the installation process that there is already a distribution there but will not offer to format the partition.
      You will need to delete the <b>  /var, /proc, /sys, /usr, /sbin,</b> and <b>/etc </b> folders, but other folders such as <b>/home</b> and <b>/MP3</b> will not be touched.
      So your data are safe. 
    <li>
     Today it is very easy to configure a file server based on NFS, so that users could have their home folders on a remote server.
    <li>
     To summarise: creating a separate home partition today is unecessary, at least with NuTyX.
     It's worth asking why Apple's MacOS operating system never recommended this.
    </ul>

   <h2>Building packages in a chroot. When and Why ?</h2>
    <p>
     The NuTyX ISOs install a base system which gives the user a choice between two scenarios in using the distribution:
      <h3>NuTyX can be considered as a "binaries" distribution.</h3>

       The user installs the needed binary packages by downloading them from the remote server.
      <p>
       Once the base system is installed, the user installs their favourite applications as explained in the online documentation.
      <p>
       A typical installation looks like:
       <pre class="command_user"><kbd>get lxdm xfce4 xfce4-extra firefox gvfs ntfs-3g transmission thunderbird</kbd></pre>
      <p>
       All the binary packages are split into base packages and sub-packages (devel, doc, man, etc); in most cases, only the base package will be installed.
       It means:
       <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />
        if the user wants to compile a package not available in binaries,
        <a href="build-in-chroot">he (she) will have to compile those packages in a chroot</a>,
        otherwise the compilation will always fail because of missing dependencies.
       </div>
     <h3>NuTyX can be considered as a "sources" distribution</h3>
       The user compiles all the packages they  need on the local machine.
      <p>
       Once the base system is installed, the user installs the development tools:
       <pre class="command_user"><kbd>get cards.devel</kbd></pre>
      <p>
       He (She) downloads the availables recipes:
       <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo ports -u</kbd></pre>
      <p>
       He (She) adjusts the <b>/etc/cards.conf</b> configuration file as:
       <pre class="output">dir /usr/ports/kde5-extra
dir /usr/ports/kde5
dir /usr/ports/lxqt-extra
dir /usr/ports/lxqt
dir /usr/ports/mate-extra
dir /usr/ports/mate
dir /usr/ports/xfce4-extra
dir /usr/ports/xfce4
dir /usr/ports/gui-extra
dir /usr/ports/gui
dir /usr/ports/cli-extra
dir /usr/ports/base
base /usr/ports/base
logdir /var/log/pkgbuild</pre>
      And can now compile the required packages <u><b>without being in a chroot</b></u>.
      So, for example, to compile the graphical server xorg:
      <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards depcreate xorg-server</kbd></pre>

   <h2>Is it possible to upgrade NuTyX (prior to 10.0) to NuTyX 10.X without reinstalling everything?</h2>
    <p>
     No. The number of changes is too great.
     The package manager has changed, the initrd has changed,
     the installer has changed, and the ports location has changed.

   <h2>How to activate the root account ?</h2>
    <p>
     As default, NuTyX does not activate the root account but, if you wish to compile your own packages, it may be a good activate the root account.
     It's very simple, type:
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>nu</kbd></pre>
     and choose <b>root</b> as user
     <p>
       <img src="graphics/faq/ActivateRoot1.png" alt="Figure 1: Specify the root account" title="Figure 1: Specify the root account"/>
     <p>
      choose a new password
     <p>
      <img src="graphics/faq/ActivateRoot2.png" alt="Figure 2: Specify the password" title="Figure 2: Specify the password"/>
     <p>
      and confirm the new password
    <p>
      <img src="graphics/faq/ActivateRoot3.png" alt="Figure 3: Confirm the password" title="Figure 3: Confirm the password"/>
     <p>
      and you're done.

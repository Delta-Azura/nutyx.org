    <h1>Building of the CHROOT (pass 1)</h1>
    <p>
     In this first pass we will build a chroot environment which will be used to build a NuTyX in a second pass.
     If you choose to use a separate partition, it should be mounted now. When done we can go on.
    <p>
     We start by creating folders, links and the right user account for the building of the first pass.
    <p>
     The first part of preparation is done via the root account and the second directly in the unprivileged account LFS.
    <p>
     The building time of the first pass can vary between 1 hour( with an 8 core processor) and probably 1 night(with a single core 32 bits).
    <p>
     It's a summary of what has to be done before starting the various scripts which will do the job automatically.
    <p>
     Note that in this article, we use only a folder and not a partition.
     It's possible to build the CHROOT in a folder.
    <h2>Administrator part:</h2>
    <p>
     <ol>
     <li>Creation of the LFS configuration variable:</li>
<pre class="command"><kbd>export LFS=/mnt/lfs</kbd></pre>
     <li>Creation of folders:</li>
<pre class="command"><kbd> mkdir -vp $LFS/{sources,tools}</kbd></pre>
     <li>Add the needed links:</li>
<pre class="command"><kbd>ln -svf $LFS/tools /
ln -svf $LFS/sources /</kbd></pre>
     <li>Creation of the lfs user:</li>
<pre class="command"><kbd>groupadd lfs
useradd -s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs
passwd lfs</kbd></pre>
     Enter the password of your choice, it's not absolutely necessary if you enter this account from root.
     <li>Owner and mode changing of the folders:</li>
<pre class="command"><kbd>chown -v lfs $LFS/{tools,sources}
chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources
chown -v lfs $LFS</kbd></pre>
     <li>Adjust the working environment: the /home/lfs/.bash_profile file:</li>
      <pre class="command"><kbd>cat &gt; /home/lfs/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; "EOF"
exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash
EOF</kbd></pre>
      and the  /home/lfs/.bashrc file
     <pre class="command"><kbd>echo "set +h
umask 022
LFS=$LFS
LC_ALL=POSIX
LFS_TARGET=$(uname -m)-nutyx-linux-gnu
PATH=/home/lfs/bin:/tools/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
export LFS LC_ALL LFS_TARGET PATH" &gt; /home/lfs/.bashrc</kbd></pre>

     </ol>
     Time to go on with the LFS unprivileged user part: 
<pre class="command"><kbd>su - lfs</kbd></pre>

     <h2>LFS part:</h2>
     <p>
      From now on, you should type all the commands as lfs user.
     <p>
      you get the latest version of the source code from git:
<pre class="command_user"><kbd>git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/nutyx/core development</kbd></pre>
     <p>
      Once this is done, a new folder is created: <b>development</b>.
      We open it and launch the first script:
<pre class="command_user"><kbd>cd development
scripts/runmebeforepass1</kbd></pre>
     <p>
      The script will check a series of verifications and NO errors should occur.
      The downloading of the sources will start automatically.
      When it's finish you just have to follow the instructions.
   
     <p>
      If everything went well, you should be reading the following messages:
     <pre class="output">=====&gt; Successfull configured</pre>
      If youâ€™re reading this, congratulations you are ready to launch the first pass for the construction of your future NuTyX, do:    
      <pre class="command_user"><kbd>cd chroot
pass</kbd></pre>

     <p>
      Let the show begin ...

<pre class="output">+ mkdir -pv /mnt/lfs/var/lib/pkg/DB
mkdir: created directory '/mnt/lfs/var'
mkdir: created directory '/mnt/lfs/var/lib'
mkdir: created directory '/mnt/lfs/var/lib/pkg'
mkdir: created directory '/mnt/lfs/var/lib/pkg/DB'
=======&gt; Building '/home/lfs/development/chroot/cards/Pkgfile' succeeded.
/home/lfs/development/chroot</pre>
    <p>
     Note that you can follow the evolution of the construction and then check that everything has gone well by consulting the folder /home/lfs/logs/chroot/ .
     For each build package there is a corresponding log.

     This little guide explains how to setup an NFS server on NuTyX.
     NFS gives you the possibility to share folders between linux computers.
     The only condition is that all the computers concerned should run NFS.
     We can say we are lucky - all the distributions support it.

     It's very easy to create a customised ISO image from a folder in an installed NuTyX system.

     If you want, you can add a graphical interface too.
     It's up to you to add all the packages you want when you install the kernel, which is the minimum required.

    This is placed in a <a class="url" href="dictionary#ID070">port</a>, which is a directory containing various files needed for building the package.

     NFS gives you the possibility to share folders between linux computers.
     The only condition is that all the computers concerned should run NFS.
     We can say we are lucky all the distributions support it.

     It's very easy to create a customised ISO image from a folder in an installed NuTyX system.
     This image can then be put on a disc or usb drive, and used to reinstall NuTyX if necessary.
     If you want, you can add a graphical interface too.
     It's up to you to add all the packages you want when you install the kernel, which is the minimum required.

    <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />
     This article is targeted at people who know what a GNU/linux distribution is.
     Ideally you should have built LFS entirely by hand at least once before trying this method.
     <a class="url" href="https://github.com/NuTyX/core/commits/master">This project is continuously in development</a>,
     so it is possible that you will encounter some errors during the build.

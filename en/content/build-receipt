<h1>Practical example of a recipe to begin</h1>
  <pre class="output">_name=libxfce4util
version=4.10.1
source=(http://downloads.nutyx.org/archives/xfce/src/xfce/${_name}/${version%.*}/${_name}-$version.tar.bz2)

build() {
cd ${_name}-$version
./configure --prefix=/usr \
--disable-static
make
make DESTDIR=$PKG install
}</pre>

  <h2>Explanations</h2>
   We wish always to describe what the package is about.
   The file <b>&lt;name_of_the_package.info&gt;</b> is going to be included in the binary and
   will be used by the package manager <b>cards</b>.
   So the description is very important and should always be written in English.
   It's important that it's all on one line.
   <pre class="output">The libxfce4util package is a basic utility library for the Xfce desktop environment</pre>
   So that the build server is able to build the package without trouble,
   it's important to specify the dependencies of your package.
   The file <b>&lt;name_of_the_package.deps&gt;</b> specifies the list of dependencies.
   Dependencies are each placed on one line.
   <pre class="output">glib
intltool
gtk-doc</pre>
   If the name of the binary package is different from the sources of the package,
   we need to define an internal variable with the name of the source package.
   As the variable <b>name</b> is already reserved, we should not use it but anything else.
   In our example, we used the variable <b>_name</b>
   <pre class="output">_name=libxfce4util</pre>
   Note that the variable <b>name </b> is set automatically by reading the name of the folder containing your receipt.
   So make sure you create a base folder with the correct "settings".
   Example to build correctly this package, it should be found in a folder name:
   <pre class="output">xfce4-libutil</pre>
   It's now time to get the sources of our package. It's shown in the next line.
   As you can see, we use the <b>_name</b> and <b>version</b> variables for this.
   For the rest of the line, if a patch is needed for example, it can be added on the next line:
   <pre class="output">source=(http://downloads.nutyx.org/archives/xfce/src/xfce/${_name}/${version%.*}/${_name}-$version.tar.bz2
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/svn/$name-$version-contribs_lib-1.patch)</pre>
Then comes the function <b>build</b> which defines what should be done.
Most of the time, it's always the same.
<pre class="output">build() {
cd ${_name}-$version
./configure --prefix=/usr \
--disable-static
make
make DESTDIR=$PKG install
}</pre>

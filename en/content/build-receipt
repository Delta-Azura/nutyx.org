<h1>Practical example of a recipe to begin</h1>
  <pre class="output">_name=libxfce4util
version=4.10.1
source=(http://downloads.nutyx.org/archives/xfce/src/xfce/${_name}/${version%.*}/${_name}-$version.tar.bz2)

build() {
cd ${_name}-$version
./configure --prefix=/usr \
--disable-static
make
make DESTDIR=$PKG install
}</pre>

  <h2>Explanations</h2>
   We wish always to describe what the package is about.
   The file <b>&lt;name_of_the_package.info&gt;</b> is going to be include in the binarie and
   will be used by the package manager <b>cards</b>.
   So the description is very important and should always be writen in english.
   It's important that it's all on one line.
   <pre class="output">The libxfce4util package is a basic utility library for the Xfce desktop environment</pre>
   If you wish that the build server is able to build the package without trouble,
   it's important to specify the dependencies of your package.
   The file <b>&lt;name_of_the_package.deps&gt;</b> is specifying the list of dependencies.
   Dependencies are placed on one line each.
   <pre class="output">glib
intltool
gtk-doc</pre>
   If the name of the binary package is different from the sources of the package,
   we need to define a internal variable with the name of the source package.
   As the variable <b>name</b> is allready reserve, we should not used it but anything else.
   In our exemple, we used the variable <b>_name</b>
   <pre class="output">_name=libxfce4util</pre>
   Note that the variable <b>name </b> is set automatically by reading the name of the folder containing your receipt.
   So make shure you create a base folder with the correct "settings".
   Example to build correctly this package, it should be found in a folder name:
   <pre class="output">xfce4-libutil</pre>
   It's now time to get the sources of our package. It's declare in the next line.
   As you can see, we use the <b>_name</b> and <b>version</b> variables for this.
   For the rest of the line, if a patch is need for exemple, it can be added on the next line:
   <pre class="output">source=(http://downloads.nutyx.org/archives/xfce/src/xfce/${_name}/${version%.*}/${_name}-$version.tar.bz2
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/svn/$name-$version-contribs_lib-1.patch)</pre>
Then comes the function <b>build</b> which define what should be done.
Most of the time, it's allways the same.
<pre class="output">build() {
cd ${_name}-$version
./configure --prefix=/usr \
--disable-static
make
make DESTDIR=$PKG install
}</pre>

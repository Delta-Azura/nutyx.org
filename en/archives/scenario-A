   <h1>Scenario A</h1>
    <a name='111'></a>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>You do not want to compile anything on your NuTyX system. However, if you want 
      specific packages that are not included in the “<b>binary collection</b>”, 
      you may need to reconsider your options. This scenario works perfectly if you want to do multiple <b>NuTyX</b>
      installations, and prefer the system to automatically carry out the entire installation on your behalf.</p>

    <h2>The /etc/cards.conf file</h2>
Check that:
<ul>
      <li>All the binary collections are activated.</p>
      <li>The architecture chosen for your machine is correct.</p>
      <li>The correct language(s) for the machine have been selected.</p>
      <li>The folder defining the base system was created.</p>
</ul><p>
      The contents of a typical <b>/etc/cards.conf</b> file:</p>
      <pre class="output">dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/xfce4-extra|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/xfce4|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/gui-extra|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/gui|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/cli-extra|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/cli|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/base|http://downloads.nutyx.org
arch x86_64
locale de
base /var/lib/pkg/depot/base
base /var/lib/pkg/depot/base-extra</pre>
        <p>Here the 6 standard binary collections <b>base</b>, <b>cli</b> and <b>gui</b> are activated, together with <b>xfce4</b> and <b>xfce4-extra</b>.</p>
        <p>The processor is a 64-bit <b>x86_64</b>.</p>
        <p> The language chosen for the installation is German (<b>locale de</b>); for English, you can ignore this line, as English is the default.</p>
        <p>The command <b>cards base -r</b> can be used at any time used to <b>return</b> to your base system. Here the folders defined as containing the base packages are those corresponding to the standard <b>base</b> collection.</p>
        <pre class="output">base /var/lib/pkg/depot/base
base /var/lib/pkg/depot/base-extra</b></pre>

    <h2>The /etc/pkgmk.conf file</h2>
      <p>In <b>scenario A</b>, the <b>/etc/pkgmk.conf</b> file is present but since you are not going to compile anything, it will not be used. Thus the development tools are not needed.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>That's all you need to set up your NuTyX. To update your database and check for any available updates, use command:</p>
        <pre class="command"><kbd>check</kbd></pre>
        <p>Want to install a Internet browser package, use command:</p>
        <pre class="command"><kbd>get firefox</kbd></pre>
        <p>To delete a package:</p>
        <pre class="command"><kbd>del firefox</kbd></pre>
        <p>That's all there is to know <img src="../graphics/smiley-tongue-out.gif" alt="Tongue out" title="Tongue out" />. I hope you'll get plenty of enjoyment using <b>NuTyX</b>.</p>

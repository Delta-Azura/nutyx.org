   <h1>Scenario E</h1>
    <a name='11'></a>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>In this Scenario we will have 2 different working Scenario environments. The first, is <b>Scenario A</b> containing the original NuTyX platform, and where you will create a dedicated folder (say /MyDownloads) in which you will produce your personal packages.</p>
<p>This scenario is the combination of TWO scenarios, one will be ... Scenario A ( <img src="../graphics/smiley-cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool" />. The second scenario is that of your isolated environment, whre you create packages from <b>Scenarios B, C and D</b>, and this keeps the original NuTyX from becoming corrupted.</p>
     <p>The correct technical term to gain access to this isolated working environment is chrooting. From now on the word <b>chroot</b> will refer to the isolated environment.</p>
     <p>Some small benefits over the previous Scenarios:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>As you never install any development packages on your main NuTyX system, it will remain a reasonable size.</li>
      <li>You must provide some Gigabytes of storage for your <b>chroot</b> environment, but this can easily be deleted when required using:
      <pre class="command"><kbd>rm -r /&lt;path-of-your-chroot&gt;</kbd></pre> and you are safely back in your  NUTyX without any <b>chroot</b>.</li>
      <li>All your packages will be compiled in the <b>chroot</b> environment, preventing any corruption of your main NuTyX system.</li>
      <li>You can gain access to your <b>chroot</b> via the X graphical interface, if you want, allowing for more flexibility. If you access the chroot environment using a console, you will be more restricted as you will not have the use of your mouse or access to your X-desktop.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>In this exercise, my machine is 64-bit with 4 cores</p>

     <p>Continuing with the process of incorporating /chroot/usr/ports/personal , we want to install our packages from the <b>chroot</b> into the main NuTyX system.</p>

  <h2>Building inside an isolated environment (chrooting)</h2>
   <p>This method is not strictly required but it is highly recommended for safety reasons.</p>
   <p>It prevents possible corruption of your regular NuTyX system. In an isolated environment, you are certain that your original NuTyX version is kept intact, even if you make errors in the chroot, and cause the entire system to crash.</p>
   <p>We now call this isolated environment a <b>chroot</b> (&quot;<b>ch</b>ange <b>root</b>&quot;).</p>
   <p>We start by install a chroot NuTyX:
   <pre class="command"><kbd>install-nutyx</kbd></pre>
   <p>You can observe your installation beginning.</p>
   <pre class="output">This installation will be on /mnt/hd                                     [ INFO ]

   <p>To also work in the <b>chroot</b> environment unimpeded, you must be able to enter and exit the <b>chroot</b> easily. A small but very powerful script below does the job. You must have root access for it to work:</p>
   <pre class="command"><kbd>install-nutyx -ec</kbd></pre>
   <p>That's absolutely brilliant :-). Just try doing that on other LFS installation systems! You will need to enter a lot of commands each time to do what this script does.</p>
   <p>This is very helpful when you wish to power down to take time out.</p>
   <div class="important"><img src="../graphics/caution.gif" width="10" height="10" alt="!!!" />From now on, you should always use following command to enter your <b>chroot</b>:</div>
   <pre class="command"><kbd>install-nutyx -ec</kbd></pre>
   <p>
    The big advantage of working in a chroot is that if you make any errors,
    it will never be detrimental to your main NuTyX system.
   <div class="important"><img src="../graphics/caution.gif" width="10" height="10" alt="!!!" />On the other hand, if you're not chrooting and you mistype some of the commands mentioned in this article, I cannot guarantee the end result and and perfect operation of your NuTyX system.</div>
   <p>
    <img src="../graphics/yippee.gif" alt="yippee" /> Everything is now in its rightful place. We can now build <a href="scenario-C#2">a package with some dependencies</a>.</p>
   <p>Well done on your achievement so far!</p>
   <p><img src="../graphics/clap.gif" alt="clap" />That's really cool isnt it ? <img src="../graphics/clap.gif" alt="clap" /></p>
   <p>Your first packet is compiled and installed. The package manager (in your chroot) integrated it into its database. Small note: if you followed this tutorial, you probably noticed that all terminal commands were made from the root of your chroot ...<img src="../graphics/smiley-cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool" />.</p>
   <p> I trust you have found the experience educationally stimulating and rewarding.</p>
   <p>Now type the following command which will gather all the relevant info about the clipit package:</p>
   <pre class="command"><kbd>cards info clipit</kbd></pre>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In this scenario, (a little reminder is always good), these are the commands you will using within NuTyX:</p>
   <pre class="command"><kbd>cards install
cards install -u
cards remove</kbd></pre>
    <p></p>
    <pre class="command"><kbd>cards depends
cards depcreate
cards level
cards base -r</kbd></pre>

    <p>
    The <b>cards</b> tool has been completely re-worked.
    The synchronisation now takes a few seconds.
    The separation between binaries and ports is a lot clearer.

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards help <file></kbd></pre>

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards depcreate</kbd></pre>
Compile a port and its d√©pendencies in the right order. Similar to the <b>prt-get</b> and <b>depinst</b> commands.

<p>
Additional man command: <b>man cards</b> and <b>man cards.conf</b>

<p>
Note: Following commands altered:

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync -i

Are now more streamlined and becomes:

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync

   <h2>Updated the documentation on the site</h2>
    <p>
    Articles <a href="recept">What's a port</a>, <a href="build-package">How to build a package</a>, <a href="generate-iso">Produce a customised ISO</a> are review.
    <h2>New kernels</h2>
    <p>
    A new <b>kernel</b> is now available, we have migrated to the improved and more stable version 3.19.4, thus removing all problematic incidences.
    <p>A new long term support kernel 3.18 is also available.
    It can be installed in parallel on the standard kernel. It has just two links to adjust in the boot folder. (initrd and kernel).
    <h2>Next ISO</h2>
    <p>
    The openssh service will not be implemented in the ISO anymore for security reasons.
    Hackers could connect remotely if the password was too weak. Even more so when the router is not doing it's firewall job.
    <p>
    We have a new article explaining how to create easilly your own ISO for distribution.

    <h2>The installation script install-saravane is once again available</h2>
    <p>
    <b>install-saravane</b> is working again. Be aware there are no kernel installed. It checks the minimum requirements: uptodate bash, gawk and wget.
    <h2>Halting  prt-get / pkgutils support</h2>
    <p>
    Support of <b>cards</b> and <b>prt-get/pkgutils</b> in parallel has been halted permanently.
    The ports of crux are compatible with <b>cards</b> but not the other way around. Under NuTyX, we keep the doc, we keep man pages devel in separates sub packages.
    If we use the ports of NuTyX with <b>pkgutils</b>, we quickly end up with big packages (kernel for ex ) and then the DB of <b>pkgutils</b> get saturated which make <b>pkgutils</b> very slow.
    <p>
    The other problem encountered was that the pre-install an post-install are not names similar under <b>cards</b> and <b>pkgutils</b>, under <b>pkgutils</b>,
    they are named <b>pre-install</b> and <b>post-install</b>.
    Under <b>cards</b>, they are named <b>&lt;name_of_the_package&gt;.pre-install</b> or <b>&lt;name_of_the_package&gt;.post-install</b>.

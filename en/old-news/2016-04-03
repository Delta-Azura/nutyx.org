    <h3>Upgrade from 8.0</h3>
     <p>An upgrade is possibible: from the 8.0 version it is possible to do it without reinstalling everything.</p>
     <p>It is absolutly necessary to be in 'none graphic mode' to make the update so we stop the graphical interface server:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>init 3</kbd></pre>
     <p>It's higly recommended to have a wired connection and start the upgrade after a:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards base -r</kbd></pre>
     <p>command. Once you're done and ready, you just have to tell <b>cards</b> to switch from version <i>8.0</i> to <i>8.1</i></p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>echo "name houaphan
version 8.1" &gt; /var/lib/pkg/nutyx-version</kbd></pre>
     <p>You are now ready to finalise the upgrade:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync
cards install -u cards
cards install -u nutyx
reboot</kbd></pre>
     <p>Before the reboot process, your NuTyX will download all the base packages and upgrade them, when your machine is up again, you will be under the<b>NuTyX houaphan 8.1</b> version.</p>
     <p>Last is to setup the proper locales again:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>setup-nutyx -cl</kbd></pre>
     <p>You will reconnize the screen, choose your locale and you are done. You can now install what ever you like for a normal installation explained in the next chapter</p>
    <h3>Install 8.1</h3>
     <p>It has to be noted that all available graphic interfaces are accessible from the versatile connection manager <b>lxdm</b>, so remember to add it (and xorg) in your packages list whatever interface you choose to install.</p>
     <p>An example of an installation with all the availables packages of gnome will therefore look like:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>check
get xorg gnome gnome-extra lxdm</kbd></pre>
     <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />Even if the <b>gdm</b> package is include in the <b>gnome</b> collection, it is not possible to connect yourself via it. But it has to be installed to make gnome work properly..</div>
     <p>To install the xfce graphical interface, we will simply replace gnome with xfce4</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>check
get xorg xfce4 xfce4-extra lxdm</kbd></pre>
     <p>If this is a new installation, remember to create at least one user with the command:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>nu</kbd></pre>
     <p>And finaly reboot your machine before trying anything else (it's the easiest way).</p>
    <h3>The news graphical interfaces</h3>
     <p>With houaphan 8.1 version, following graphical interfaces <b>kde5</b>, <b>gnome</b>, <b>mate</b>, <b>lxde</b>, <b>xfce4</b>, <b>openbox</b> are now  available in binaries.</p>
     <p>If you want to install another graphical interface you will need to compile it.</p>
    <h3>The new <b>2.0</b> cards features</h3>
     <p>Cards in <b>2.0</b> version can now make a full upgrade of your installation.
     A lot of internal reorganisation in the code to make cards more easy to maintain. You can always consult <a href="https://github.com/NuTyX/cards/commits/master">the changelog.</a></p>
     <p>Together with the new NuTyX 8.1 startup script, <b>cards</b> is now able to make upgrades on its own. If there are some available upgrades, at the shutdown of the computer, <b>cards</b> will downloads and upgrade obsolet versions of your binaries.</p>
     <p>This new cards version include a API library which will give the possibility to create an "easy" graphical interface. This graphical interface will depends on the <b>libcards</b> library only.</p>
     <p>To be able to reuse (partially) existings ARCH-Linux recipes, new variables are now recognised, the <b>3</b> different valid Pkgfiles show possible variables:</p>

     <p>A big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/peter1000">peter1000</a> who made a big work of investigation, and track down a lot of bugs. We had the chance to exchange a lot of experience. peter1000 even started his own fork of cards.</p>
     <p><a href="https://github.com/NuTyX/cards/blob/master/scripts/pkgmk2.in">peter1000</a> has start a pkgmk2 script with support of colors, NLS support, more source formats like git, bazard, svn etc. You are welcome to test this new script.</p>
    <h3>The difference between a &lt;nnn&gt; collection and a  &lt;nnn-extra&gt; collection</h3>
     <p>There is a difference between, for example, the collection <b>'cli'</b> and <b>'cli-extra'</b>: The ports and binary in the collection <b><i>'cli'</i></b> are almost frozen in their version at the time of the release of NuTyX version, while ports and binary collections <b><i>-extra</i> </b> can be updated at any time.</p>
     <p>This technique isolates the <b>'central system'</b> (ie collections <b><i>'base'</i></b>, <b><i>'cli'</i></b> and <b><i>'gui'</i></b>) updates that may be on the <i>"peripheral"</i> applications contained in <b><i>-extra </i></b> collections.</p>
     <p>Therefore, applications found in the <b><i>'base-extra' </i></b>, <b><i> 'cli-extra' </i></b> or <b><i>'gui-extra'</i></b> collections are completely independent from the <b>'central system'</b>, technically it means no dependence of the central system 'must s find there.</p>
    <h3>The new installation script</h3>
     <p>The <b>bash</b> script <a href="http://downloads.nutyx.org/install-nutyx">install-nutyx</a> works now as a real application. It has the following options:</p>
     <li>Intall NuTyX in a folder
      <pre class="command"><kbd>LFS=/mnt/lfs bash install-nutyx</kbd></pre>
<p>The script will analyse the <b>/etc/install-nutyx.conf</b> file if it exist and contains the following define variables, they are at the moment 4 configurables variables: the installation path define by the <b>LFS</b> variable, the url adress of the mirror where are the binaries located via the <b>URL</b> variable, the version to installed (8.1, stable or current) define by the <b>VERSION</b> variable and finaly the <b>local</b> path of the downloaded binaries define by the <b>DEPOT</b> variable. Here is a summary example of the <b>/etc/install-nutyx.conf</b> file:</p>
     <pre class="output">URL="http://localhost"
DEPOT="/DEPOT"
LFS="/mnt/lfs"
VERSION="current"</pre>
</li>
     <p>At the moment the <b>VERSION</b> variable can have 3 values: "current", "stable" or "8.1" which is, by the way the one by default.</p>
    <li>Using the configuration files located in the  <b>/etc/install-nutyx.conf.d/</b> folder when NuTyX is installed, here is the list:

    <li>Only installing the configuration files, need in case you want to build NuTyX from scratch:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-nutyx -ic</kbd></pre></li>
    <li>To enter a chroot, we use the <b>-ec</b> option
     <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-nutyx -ec</kbd></pre></li>
    <li>Print the version of the script, the version will also specify which branch will be used for the installation:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-nutyx -v</kbd></pre></li>
    <li>Print a help of the script
     <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-nutyx -h</kbd></pre></li>
   <h3>The github website and the different projects</h3>
     <p>You can find all the recipes, the installer code, the site, the documentation on the website <a href="https://github.com/NuTyX">github</a>. You are welcome <a href="https://github.com/nutyx?tab=repositories">to fork them and propose pull request</a> to improve the quality of the distribution</p>
   <h3>The construction of NuTyX</h3>
     <p>The construction method is now based on sources available at <a href="https://github.com/NuTyX/core">https://github.com/NuTyX/core</a></p>
     <p>The NuTyX construction thus follows the commits on the current branch of houaphan.</p>
     <p>To ensure the disponibility of the sources of all the packages need for a basic system, they are now available at <a href="http://downloads.nutyx.org/current/sources">sources</a>.</p>
   <h3>Thanks to all</h3>
     <p>Thanks to Pierre for all the commits on <b>kf5 - plasma</b>, I think we have one of the best kf5 - plasma environment.</p>
     <p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/fanch">Fanch</a> who has reinitiated the <b>lxde, cinnamon, gnome, enlightenment and mate</b> collections. Fanch is very active on some forks of the existing NuTyX collections. You can follow his work, fork or/ and do pull requets on any of the collection found on <a href="https://github.com/fanch?tab=repositories">github</a></p>
     <p>I would like to thank <b>berlius</b> for his work on the building process of a NuTyX for the arm processor. There are still corners to round, but it's very promissing.</p>
     <p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/peter1000">peter1000</a> for his work on cards (pkgmk2) and all his feedback that has permitted to improve the quality of cards.</p>
     <p>Thanks to <b>mahmutov</b> for the turkish translation of the web site, NuTyX becomes now really international.</p>

 <h2>Thanks</h2>
   I regret to announce the disappearance of a very important member of the NuTyX project.
   Pierre's family informed me some time ago of his death on Friday, June 30, 2017.
   Pierre was a NuTyX contributor for almost 9 years.
   He is the author of many NuTyX packages such as KDE, Firefox, Libreoffice, thunderbird, etc.
  <p>
    I can not thank you enough for your contributions to the development of NuTyX.

 <p>
  Thanks to Greg for his works on collections.
 <p>
  Thanks to Harold for his work in progress on translation of the ISO in many languages.
 <p>
  And of course a big thanks to the "Linux From Scratch" team for the big help in building the new toolchain.

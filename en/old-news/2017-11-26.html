<p>
 If you're agains this rule, get rid of the <i>flcards</i> package and uses the CLI or edit the <i>/etc/sudoers</i> to your fit.
<h3>- xorg-app, xorg-font, xorg-proto and xorg packages are now splitted</h3>

<h3>- Cards new functionalities</h3>
<p>
 The package manager is now taking care of most of the post-installation automatically.
 As a result, installation of a big set is now even more fast.
<h3>- New Branchs concept</h3>
<p>
 After a long reflexion with Pierre B., we decide to propose several 'versions' for the next major release of NuTyX.
<p>
 Some users prefer to keep NuTyX uptodate, some others don't want to see any update comming when installing something
<p>
 The next stable version of NuTyX will use 3 differents versions to match every users needs.
<ul>
 <li>
  The "stable" branch
  <p>
   This is the stable version of NuTyX. Every packages are frozen at the time of it's release, only security updates will be apply.
  <p>
   New packages can still be added
 <li>
  The "current" branch
  <p>
   The "base" is frozen, only security updates will be apply.
  <p>
   The "cli" and "gui" collections will receives updates in cases they are dependencies that need to be update for any final package. 
	Security updates will be apply
  <p>
   The others collections will get updates as normal.
  <p>
   The "current" branch stay compatible with the "stable" one, they will be both used for minor updates of NuTyX  (10.1, 10.2, etc).
 <li>
  The "development" (or "master") branch
  <p>
   It's the main line (master) of the GIT project for every available collections
  <p>
   The update process is a "rolling release" mode during the all life of the stable version and it's minor versions (about one year)
  <p>
   Since all updates are very big and very often, the  "development" branch is most of the time not compatible with the stable version of NuTyX.
   In this case merging into the "stable" branch is never possible.
  </ul>
<p>
 The "stable" and "current" brannchs have a "limited lifetime" corresponding to the lifetime of the stable version of NuTyX at that time. 

<h2>For contributors:</h2>
<h3>- install-nutyx Script new functionnalities</h3>
<p>
 The script is able to install a 32 bits NuTyX into a 64 bits host machine. 
<p>
 It's possible to pass the branch to installed via argument.
<h3>- build-collection script new functionnalities</h3>
<p>
 The script is now autonomus, it's just need to specify the path of the GIT project in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.
<p>
 The other 3 mounting points use defaults directories if not specified via available variables or via <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.
<h3>- Recept news fonctionnalities:</h3>
<h4>The 'release' variable is optionnal</h4>
<p>
 If the recept of a package is new, it's not needed to specify the <i>release</i> variable.
 It will be set automatiquement to '1'.
<p>
 Only if you need to rebuild the package set it to whaterver you want, probably '2'
<pre class="output">release=2</pre>
<h4>The 'build' variable and 'build()' function</h4>
<p>
 If the 'build' variable is properly set, it will automatically set the content of the build() function
<p>
 Possible values are:
 <ul>
  <li>
   autotools
  <li>
   python2
  <li>
   python3
  <li>
   xorg
  <li>
   kde5
 </ul>
<p>
 If the 'build()' function and the build variable are empty, it will be the default build() function apply to the package.
<h4>The 'uptodate' function</h4>
<p>
 The 'uptodate' function can be used by the <i>pkgmk</i> script
<p>
 It is call up via the '-itd' option of <i>pkgmk</i> script.
<p>
 This function (if existing and properly set) is checking the upstream source.
 If the version of the recept is obsolet, it will be printed out.
 h4>Services installation</h4>
<p>
 The service installation is now done via the following code:
<p>Example of the 'sshd' service</p>
   <pre class="output">..
nutyx_version=9.91
source=(http://downloads.nutyx.org/files/nutyx-${nutyx_version}.tar.xz
        https://....)
build() {
cd ${name}-$version
./configure --prefix=/usr \
--disable-static
..
..
# Service
cd $SRC/nutyx-${nutyx_version}
make DESTDIR=$PKG install-sshd
}</pre>
<h4>The run_&lt;nom_de_groupe&gt; variable</h4>
 <p>
  It is now possible to specify specific dependencies for a sub package. 
 <p>
  Example of depencies for the 'devel' sub-package:
 <p>
  run_devel=(glib.devel gtk3.devel)
<h4>Obsolets post-intallations</h4>
 <p>
 
  The 'generic' post-installation are now done automaticaly by the package manager directy at the end of the installation transaction.
  <p>
  It's no need to specify them in the ports.

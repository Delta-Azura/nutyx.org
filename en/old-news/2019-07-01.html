<h2>CARDS</h2>
 <p>
  CARDS is now able to track obsolete packages.
  A package is obsolete when it's not available anymore on the remote server.
  Such a package is deleted automatically from your local installation if installed. 
<h2>Upgrade process</h2>
<p>
 Since this is a minor release, an upgrade is possible.
<p>
 For a successfull upgrade, the 'cards' package needs to be updated first.
<p>
 Please use following commands to proceed:
 <pre class="command_user"><kbd>check</kbd></pre>
 We then update cards first:
 <pre class="command_user"><kbd>up cards</kbd></pre>
 We can now finish the upgrade process:
 <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards upgrade</kbd></pre>

<h2>Renaming and Splitting</h2> 
<p>
 Renaming of python3 in python,
 the split of qt5 and the latest updates had big impacts on all the packages.
 As a result, the NuTyX team decides to recompile ALL the packages for this new version.
<p>
 We took the opportunity to adjust a few others things.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>
  The base-extra collection is now integrated in the base collection.
 <li>
   The /usr/lib64 -&gt; /usr/lib and /lib64 -&gt; /lib links are removed.
</ul>
   The /usr/lib64 directory should not exist anymore.
 <h2>Cards 2.1.106</h2>
  <p>
   The cards default configuration files are corrected so they are adapted to the new collections list.
   The base-extra collection is delete from the configuration files and in documentation.
  <p>
   The french translation is almost complete. Others translations are very welcome.

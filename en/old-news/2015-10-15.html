   <h2>NuTyX houaphan 8.0 available with cards 1.3.3</h2>
    <h3>Introduction for the impatient</h3>
     <p>
     Eleven months after the <b>Saravane 14.11</b> version release and five months after the release of the <b>15.05 Saravane</b>, I am proud to announce the release of NuTyX. His code name is <b>Houaphan</b>.
     The first version available is in <b>8.0</b>.
     Why that number? Time passes very quickly, <b>Houaphan</b> is already the 8th major release since the first public version of NuTyX ie in 2007.
     The following summarizes several new packages: 
      <ul>
       <li>glibc 2.22
       <li>gcc 5.2.0
       <li>kernel 4.2.0

       <li>...</li>
      </ul>
     <p>
     It has to be noted that all available graphic interfaces are accessible from the versatile connection manager <b>lxdm</b>,
     so remember to add it (and xorg) in your packages list whatever interface you choose to install.
     <p>An example of an installation with all the availables packages of gnome will therefore look like:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>check
get xorg gnome gnome-extra lxdm</kbd></pre>
     <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />Even if the <b>gdm</b> package is include in the <b>gnome</b> collection, it not possible to connect yourself via it. But it has to be installed to make gnome working properly..</div>
     <p>
     To install the xfce graphical interface, we will simply replace gnome with xfce4.
     <pre class="command"><kbd>check
get xorg xfce4 xfce4-extra lxdm</kbd></pre>
     <p>
     Remember to create at least one user with the command:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>nu</kbd></pre>
     <p>
     And finaly reboot your machine before trying anything else (it's the easiest way).
    <h3>The news graphical interfaces</h3>
     <p>With houaphan version, graphical interfaces <b>kde5</b>, <b>gnome</b>, <b>mate</b>, <b>lxde</b>, <b>lxqt</b> are now also available.
    <h3>The new 1.3.x cards features</h3>
     <p>
     Cards in <b>1.3.3</b> version can install one or more packages, one or more collections, or a mixture of packages and collections.
     If a package and a collection have the same name, it will be the package (and its dependencies) that will be installed.
     <p>
     You don't have to specify the architecture of your machine in the cards configuration file.
     In addition, the URL specifying the download mirror is now made simple.
     <p>
     In a package research now also shows the result of the collection or package (s) found (s).
     <p>
     The new configuration format is now easier as shown in the example below:
      <pre class="output">dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/gui|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/xfce4-extra|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/xfce4|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/cli|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/base|http://downloads.nutyx.org
base /var/lib/pkg/depot/base
base /var/lib/pkg/depot/base-extra
locale fr</pre>
    <h3>The difference between a &lt;nnn&gt; collection and a  &lt;nnn-extra&gt; collection</h3>
     <p>
     There is a difference between, for example, the collection <b>'cli'</b> and <b>'cli-extra'</b>:
     The ports and binary in the collection <b><i>'cli'</i></b> are almost frozen in their version at the time of the release of NuTyX version, while ports and binary collections <b><i>-extra</i> </b> can be updated
     at any time.
     <p>
     This technique isolates the <b>'central system'</b> (ie collections <b><i>'base'</i></b>, <b><i>'cli'</i></b> and <b><i>'gui'</i></b>) updates that may be on the <i>"peripheral"</i> applications contained in <b><i>-extra </i></b> collections.</p>
     <p>
     Therefore, applications found in the <b><i>'base-extra' </i></b>, <b><i> 'cli-extra' </i></b> or <b><i>'gui-extra'</i></b> collections are completely independent
     from the <b>'central system'</b>, technically it means no dependence of the central system 'must s find there.
    <h3>The new installation script</h3>
     <p>
     The <b>bash</b> script <a href="http://downloads.nutyx.org/install-houaphan">install-houaphan</a> works now as a real application. It has the following options:
     <li>Intall NuTyX in a folder
      <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-houaphan -p /mnt/lfs</kbd></pre>
<p>The script will analyse the contents of the <b>/etc/install-houphan.conf</b> if it exist and contains the following define variables, they are at the moment 4 configurables variables: the installation path define by the <b>LFS</b> variable, the url adress of the mirror where are the binaries located via the <b>URL</b> variable, the version to installed (8.0 or current) define by the <b>VERSION</b> variable and finaly the <b>local</b> path of the downloaded binaries define by the <b>DEPOT</b> variable. Here is a summary example of the <b>/etc/install-houphan.conf</b> file:</p>
     <pre class="output">URL="http://192.168.254.254"
DEPOT="/houaphan"
LFS="/mnt/lfs"
VERSION="current"</pre>
</li> 
     <p>At the moment the <b>VERSION</b> variable can have 2 values: "current" ou "8.0" which is, by the way the one by default.</p>
    <li>Using the configuration files located in the  <b>/etc/install-houphan.conf.d/</b> folder when NuTyX is installed, here is the list:
      <p></p>

     <p>
    <li>Only installing the configuration files, need in case you want to build NuTyX from scratch:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-houaphan -ic</kbd></pre></li>
    <li>The <b>enter-chroot</b> script is now obsolete, to enter a chroot, we use the <b>-ec</b> option
     <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-houaphan -ec</kbd></pre></li>
    <li>Print the version of the script, the version will also specify which branch will be used for the installation:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-houaphan -v</kbd></pre></li>
    <li>Print a help of the script
     <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-houaphan -h</kbd></pre></li>
   <h3>The github website and the different projects</h3>
     <p>You can find all the recipes, the installer code, the site, the documentation on the website <a href="https://github.com/NuTyX">github</a>.
   <h3>The construction of NuTyX</h3>
     <p>The construction method is now based on sources available at <a href="https://github.com/NuTyX/houaphan">https://github.com/NuTyX/houaphan</a>.
     <p>
     The NuTyX construction thus follows the commits on the current branch of houaphan.
     <p>
     To ensure the disponibily of the sources of all the packages need for a basic system,
     they are now available at <a href="http://downloads.nutyx.org/current/sources">http://downloads.nutyx.org/current/sources</a> sources.
   <h3>The renaming of some packages</h3>
    <p>
    Over time, many packages (especially libraries) offers several versions of the same installable package sets (qt, gtk, etc.) some time we must be consistent in  the names of thoseslibraries.
   <h3>The 32 bits version</h3>
    <p>
    For this new version of NuTyX, the 32-bit version is proposed as a base system, the user may wish to compile himself packages that he wants to use.

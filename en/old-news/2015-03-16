   <h2>New 32bits and 64 bits iso available</h2>
    <p>
    I'm pleased to make available new 32 bits and 64 bits ISO. Click on following down-loadable links:
    <a href="http://download.nutyx.org/NuTyX_x86_64-saravane-20150315.iso">In 64 bits</a> and <a href="http://download.nutyx.org/NuTyX_i686-saravane-20150315.iso">in 32 bits</a>
    <p>
     The installer is made even more simple.
     From now on if you pre-configure and format the destination partition before launching the installer, the CD <a href="http://nutyx.org/en/install#4">ask no questions
     and the installation will start immediatly</a>within 15 seconds max.
    <p>
     Openssh service is available from the moment you have installed the base.
     It means you can connect from a terminal from the host machine if you did an installation in virtualbox (with the network configured as bridge).
     Also very usefull if you have two PC's on the network.

     <b>Wifi</b> should works again after xcfe4 / kde installation.

     <h3>The ISO</h3>
      <p>
      If the dedicated partitioning attributes was finalized prior to installation, then you will simply only need to choose “install” from the main menu.
      <p>
      The installation of the boot process has also been simplified:
      If you prefer to install the GRUB <u>BEFORE</u> installing NuTyX, you are still able to choose a NuTyX destination partition after setting up GRUB.
      If you prefer to install NuTyX immediately and install GRUB later at the end, GRUB will be automatically installed on your NuTyX partition.
      <p>
      The kernel used is a 3.19.6. An LTS (Long term support) release is also available in Version 3.18.12.
      <p>
      The ISO is now 100% translated in the following languages: Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Norwegian and Swedish.
      <p>
      The file system <b>jfs</b> has also been included as a possible choice. Although endorsed by Red-Hat, <b>jfs</b> may run into copyright issues later on, as it was created by IBM.
      For performance, there is <b>btrfs</b>, for stability and control there is <b>xfs</b>.
      <p>
      If you want to install NuTyX on a partition formatted with btrfs (dev/sda2 for exemple), you <u>must</u> create another partition for grub (/dev/sda1 for exemple).
      For more clarity <b>/dev/sda1</b> will be formatted as <b>ext2</b>, and house GRUB. While <b>/dev/sda2</b> will be formatted as <b>btrfs</b> and house your NuTyX.
     <h3>The installation script</h3>
     <p>
     It is now very easy and possible to install NuTyX from <u>any distribution</u>. The past problems with the <b>BASH</b> interpreter has now been resolved.
     <p>
     Two variables are good to know:
     <pre class="output">LFS
URL</pre>
     <p>
     The <b>LFS</b> variable give the possibility to choose a destination folder. Once defined and "exported", the installation command gets simple as:
     <pre class="output">bash install-saravane</pre>
     <p>
     The <b>URL</b> allows you to define a personal mirror.
     Once the installation is finish, the <b>cards</b> command will continue to use this mirror.
    <h3>The web site</h3>
     <p>
     All articles have been updated for the new functionalities of the package manager <b>cards 1.0</b>.
     <p>
     The article on <b>"building a package"</b> has been completely reviewed.
     It explains in detail what's a scenario under NuTyX, what's a collection, the dependencies for compilation, the configuration for each scenario, etc.
     <p>
     An article about <b>"configuring a firewall"</b> has been written by a user of NuTyX, <b>sh4d0w</b> I warmly thank him.
     I encourage all users to provide and submit their own. If your article is complete and correct, it will be added to our site.
    <h3>The source code of Saravane is available on github.com/NuTyX, as well a bug tracker. </h3>
     <p>
     You can find all of my work on NuTyX at: https://github.com/NuTyX, you will find the source code of the following list:
     cards, ports collection base, console and desktop of Saravane, the scripts, the pass 1 and 2 for the NuTyX construction,
     the files structure that constitutes the basic system NuTyX (the package aaabasicfs), the initrd, the installer and all the html pages from the web site.
     There are also ports from the collection "extra".
     <p>
     It is very easy now to monitor NuTyX, you can instantly submit your wishes and bugs on github platform.
    <h3>The cards package manager is finaly release in 1.0 version</h3>
     <p>
     In its final version, <b>cards</b> is now even faster and easier to use. The most common commands have been simplified:
     <p>
     To synchronise information with the default mirror:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync</kbd></pre>
     <p>
     To know the installed packages:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards list</kbd></pre>
     <p>
     For details of an installed package:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards info &lt;name_of_my_package&gt;</kbd></pre>
     <p>
     To check the obsolete list of installed packages:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards diff</kbd></pre>
     <p>
     For detail of the cards command:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>man cards</kbd></pre>
     <p>
     Some new cards commands:
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards query
cards files
cards help
cards purge
cards depcreate</kbd></pre>
     <p>
     As for the packager, new variables have been added:
     <pre class="output">PKGMK_LOCALES</pre>
     <p>
     Default value:
     <pre class="output">PKGMK_LOCALES=(fr)</pre>
     <p>Define the locales that we want to keep in the binary, example: PKGMK_LOCALES=(fr nl) will conserve the french and italians locales (if they were available at compile time)
     in the sub packages <b>&lt;name_package&gt;.fr and &lt;name_package&gt;.it</b>.
     <pre class="output">PKGMK_IGNORE_REPO</pre>
     <p>
     Default value:
     <pre class="output">PKGMK_IGNORE_REPO="yes"</pre>
     <p>
     If set as <b>"no"</b>, the file <b>.PKGREPO</b> of the collection (means the name of the parent folder of your package) will be regenerated.
     This file is needed if you wish to installed some packages outside of your chroot.
